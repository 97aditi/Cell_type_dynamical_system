# Cell Type Dynamical Systems [CHECK BACK IN A WEEK!]

This is the code repository for cell-type specific linear dynamical systems, based on [Jha, Gupta, Brody, Pillow (NeurIPS 2024)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.08.602520v1).


#### Setup instructions:
This is built on top of the [SSM package](https://github.com/lindermanlab/ssm/tree/master/ssm). It also uses MOSEK to solve constrained optimizations.
